## Detailed Steps

### Data Loading & Preprocessing
We start by loading the necessary datasets and performing initial preprocessing steps. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and optimizing memory usage. The preprocessing pipeline ensures that the data is clean and ready for feature extraction and model training.

### Data Augmentation
To enhance the model's ability to generalize, we apply data augmentation techniques. This involves generating synthetic samples or transforming existing data to increase the diversity and robustness of the training set.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. We create new features based on domain knowledge and data exploration. This includes aggregating statistics, creating polynomial features, and encoding categorical variables. Advanced feature selection methods are also employed to retain the most relevant features for the model.

### Model Building & Training
We implement and train several machine learning models, including:
- **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.
- **CatBoost**: A gradient boosting algorithm that handles categorical features efficiently.

These models are trained using cross-validation to ensure robust performance and to prevent overfitting.

### Ensemble Learning
To further improve prediction accuracy and model stability, we use ensemble learning techniques. Our custom Voting Model combines the predictions of LightGBM and CatBoost models. By averaging the predictions, the ensemble model often outperforms individual models in terms of accuracy and stability.

### Inference
In the inference phase, we use the trained ensemble model to make predictions on the test set. The final output is a set of predictions that can be submitted for evaluation.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full pipeline for developing a robust credit risk model. By focusing on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and ensemble learning, we achieve high accuracy and model stability. This approach is essential for effective credit risk assessment and can be adapted to other domains requiring reliable predictive modeling.
